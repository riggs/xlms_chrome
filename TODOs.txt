Keep system from sleeping while exercise is running:
    // https://developer.chrome.com/apps/power
    chrome.power.requestKeepAwake("display");

Figure out workflow for installing and then launching app when not installed.

video.js(x?) provides an easy api to let plugins start/stop recording while still controlling the pipeline from XLMS

Pokey UX:
    Click link in XLMS, App launches
    UI: Video display, box status (tools connected & in holder?), 'Record' button
    Once tools are ready, 'Record' button enabled
    Once recording, when tools are removed, exercise starts, elapsed time is displayed in status

Peggy UX:
    Launch via XLMS
    UI: Peg state display: un/covered, Video display, 'Record' button
    Once tools and pegs are in place, 'Record' button enabled
    Once recording, when tools are removed, exercise starts, elapsed time is displayed in status
    Peg state display always live updating
